# ♻️ Object Sorting for Waste Management - Unity Simulation Project

> 💡 This is a Unity-based AI + Simulation project built for the Hackathon Level 3 (Finale) under the theme **“Object Sorting for Waste Management”**.  
> It demonstrates smart sorting of waste objects using logic-based classification, conveyor mechanics, and real-time scoring.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To simulate an **automated waste sorting system** where waste items (plastic, paper, organic) are:
- Detected based on type
- Moved on a conveyor belt
- Automatically directed into the correct bins
- Scored based on correct sorting

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Realistic 3D models: plastic bottle, banana peel, paper sheet  
✅ Conveyor belt system with object pushing logic  
✅ Object type detection using attached scripts (`WasteType`)  
✅ Dynamic sorting using `WasteDetector` and `WasteSorter`  
✅ Real-time scoring system displayed in UI  
✅ Labelled bins and clean simulation layout  
✅ Scene reset button and sound effects support (optional)

## 🔧 Built With

- **Unity Version**: 2022.3.0f1 LTS  
- **Platform**: PC Simulation  
- **Language**: C#

## 🕹️ How to Run the Project

1. **Download or clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aasi0016/ObjectSorting_WasteManagement.git
Open in Unity 2022.3 LTS

Open Unity Hub → Click Open → Select this folder

Run the Simulation

Open the main scene from Assets/Scenes/

Press Play in Unity Editor

Try It Out

Watch objects move on conveyor

See how each object is detected and sorted

You can reset the scene using the Restart button in UI

Logs like Object detected: Plastic will appear in the Console

This project uses basic AI simulation logic (no ML libraries)

Score updates on correct bin entry
